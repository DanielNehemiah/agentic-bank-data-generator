Developing a Data Schema

I've started by defining a comprehensive data schema for a fictional European bank. I'm focusing on customer data, KYC protocols (including screening), and transaction details across the three core business areas. I'm aiming for a robust and easily navigable design.

Constructing the Architecture

I'm now in the process of building the agentic system with LangGraph. I've broken down the data generation into distinct nodes: customer creation, KYC updates, transaction initiation, compliance screenings, ongoing transaction data, and suspicious activity flagging. The Faker library will be pivotal for realistic customer and KYC details. I'll utilize statistical distributions like log-normal and Poisson to model transaction amounts and frequencies, coupled with a Markov chain to simulate customer transaction behavior over time.

Detailing the Database

I've outlined a robust database schema that includes customer details, KYC data, screening logs, transaction information, and suspicious activity flags. I plan to use the sqlite3 library to build the database, ensuring efficient and structured data storage. The focus is on a comprehensive and flexible structure to accommodate diverse data types.

Expanding the Framework

I've shifted focus to establishing a robust framework for simulating the European bank's operations. My current priority is to design the detailed data schema, encompassing customer information, KYC protocols with integrated screening processes, and a comprehensive transaction history across all three business lines. This will directly feed into the SQLite database creation, ensuring structured and efficient data storage. Following this, I will design and build the LangGraph agentic system, with individual nodes for customer generation, KYC updates, transaction simulation, periodic compliance checks, and flagging of suspicious activities. I will integrate the Faker library and statistical distributions for realistic data simulation.

Defining the Workflow

I've finalized the detailed database schema and now I'm creating the SQLite database using Python. Next, I'll structure the LangGraph environment and begin to code the individual nodes. These will simulate customer creation, KYC processes, initial transactions, compliance checks, ongoing transactions, and suspicious activity flagging, all integrated within the framework. I'm focusing on creating realistic data flow from customer generation to transaction monitoring.
